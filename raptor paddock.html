            <h3>Raptor paddock</h3>
            <p>There are four raptors in the paddock. Thier names are Blue, Charlie, Delta, and Echo. 
                When you spend coins, food or DNA, you unlock the prize wheel for the rarity level you purchased. 
                Purchasing the Common MOD prize wheel can also net you rare MODs if you're lucky. 
                Each raptor has a different selection of MODs with some overlap, so if you cannot afford to pay for one raptor's MODs, you can try a different raptor.
            </p>
