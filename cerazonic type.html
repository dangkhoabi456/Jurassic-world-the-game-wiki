        <ul>
            <li><img src="images/Snow type.webp"height="25">Snows are strong against Savannahs, but weak against Caverns. This was the first type revealed, as the Woolly Mammoth was released prior to the Cenozoic Park update. 
                Consisting entirely of mammals, it is represented by elephants, deer-like mammals, cat-like mammals, and bear-like mammals.</li>
            <li><img src="images/Savannah type.webp"height="25">Savannahs are strong against Caverns, but weak against Snows. 
                It is represented by flightless birds, rhinoceros-like mammals (except Woolly Rhinoceros), kangaroos, indricotheres, and entelodonts.</li>
            <li><img src="images/Cavern type.webp"height="25">Caverns are strong against Snows, but weak against Savannahs. 
                It is represented by dog-like mammals, giant ground sloths (except Mylodon), large snakes, turtles and glyptodonts.</li>
