        <ul>
            <li><img src="images/Surface type.webp"height="25" width="25">Surfaces are strong against Caves, but weak against Reefs. This was the first type revealed, as the Mosasaurus was released prior to the Aquatic Park update. 
                It is represented by mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and shark-like fish.</li>
            <li><img src="images/Reef type.webp"height="25" width="25">Reefs are strong against Surfaces, but weak against Caves. 
                Represented by pliosaurs, leptocliedids, ichthyosaurs, and turtle-like reptiles, it is currently the only type represented entirely by marine reptiles.</li>
            <li><img src="images/Cave type.webp"height="25" width="25">Caves are strong against Reefs, but weak against Surfaces. 
                This type is mainly represented by non-tetrapods such as non-cartilaginous fish and cephalopods, but also features crocodile-like reptiles.</li>
