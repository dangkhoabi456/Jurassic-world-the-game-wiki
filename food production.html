<h3>Food production</h3>
        <p>The food production factory produces <a href="food.html">food</a> for <a href="coin.html">coins</a>.In the tutorial, Claire shows the player how to make food with 600 coins. 
            This factory is a free building and costs zero coins. However, the player can not sell this Building. 
            This has levels where the player can upgrade with coins and <a href="cash.html">cash</a> for faster food production in a longer period of time.</p>
