<h3>Jurassic Types</h3>
<ul>
<li><img src="images/Carnivore icon.webp" height="25" width="25"> Carnivores are strong against Herbivores, but weak to Amphibians. 
    They are represented almost entirely by theropod dinosaurs, as well as some synapsids.</li>
<li><img src="images/Herbivore icon.webp" height="25" width="25">Herbivores are strong against Pterosaurs, but weak to Carnivores. 
    With the exception of ornithomimids and therizinosaurids, they are represented entirely by non-theropod dinosaurs.</li>
<li><img src="images/Pterosaur icon.webp" height="25" width="25">Pterosaurs are strong against Amphibians, but weak to Herbivores.
     As the name suggests, they are represented by several species of large pterosaurs, along with some smaller ones.</li>
<li><img src="images/Amphibian icon.webp" height="25" width="25"> Amphibians are strong against Carnivores, but weak to Pterosaurs. 
    Although mostly represented by large amphibians, various archosaurs, crocodylomorphs and primitive tetrapods are also featured in this group.</li>
</ul>
