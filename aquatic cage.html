        <h3>Aquatic cage.</h3>
        <p>Aquatic cage is basically a large pool that contain all the Aquatic creatures in it, it doesn't split into types like Land cage.
            Aquatic cage located in a large swimming pool which have a mosasaurus swimming around in it.
            Usually you can only access to aquatic cage at level 30, because at level 30 your battle stage will unlock and have a prize as a Prognathodon
         which is your first aquatic creature. However, if you somehow manage to unlock aquatic creature before level 30(through packs or participate in event),
     you are still allowed to access to aquatic cage.</p>
